Well I figured it was about time I attempted to maintain another website. It seems as the years rolled by since I last tried my hand at HTML/CSS I have forgotten approximately 100% of what I knew and the world moved on without me. Web devleopment now-a-days hardly resembels what it looked like the last time I tried my hand at slinging some CSS, but it seems that even old gray beards like me can muddle their way though with Chrome Devtools and "Inspect Element". Luckily, there's some great new projects like (Hugo)[https://www.gohugo.io], along with this awesome theme (After Darl)[https://comfusion.github.io/after-dark/], that I can use to help me get back in the swing of things, who knows, maybe I'll start writing some SCSS or doing some of that NPM stuff all the kids are talking about now.

I am going to try and write more about the stuff I am working with lately (Ansible, Terraform) and stuff that I am trying to learn (CI/CD, Automation, Kubernetes).
